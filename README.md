# ascii_web
A simple, standalone web app built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that converts any image into colorful or monochrome ASCII art right in your browser. No setup, installation, or downloads are needed 

Just open the index.html file and start using it instantly. You can drag and drop or upload images, tweak width, height, and character sets, and toggle between colorized or grayscale output. The ASCII art automatically stays centered and scales smoothly with the window size, and you can export the results as .txt, .html, .png, or .jpg 

All processed locally with no internet connection required.
